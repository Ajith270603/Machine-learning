Project Title: Integrated Disease Prediction System 
 
Description: 
 
Developed an integrated machine learning model to predict multiple diseases, including lung cancer, hypothyroidism, and Parkinson's disease. Leveraged diverse datasets and advanced predictive analytics to enhance early detection and diagnosis.

Key contributions includes, 
 
Lung Cancer Prediction: 
Implemented a Logistic Regression on medical data to accurately predict the likelihood of lung cancer. Achieved 90% accuracy in cross-validation, demonstrating robustness and reliability.

Hypothyroid Prediction: 
Engineered a feature-rich predictive model using patient health records and clinical data to forecast the probability of hypothyroidism. Employed Logistic Regression to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. 
 
Parkinson's Disease Prediction: 
Applied time-series analysis and feature engineering on patient movement data to develop a predictive model for early identification of Parkinson's disease. Attained 92% accuracy score in validation with Support Vector Classifier, showcasing the model's effectiveness in distinguishing early-stage symptoms.

The project not only showcased technical proficiency but also demonstrated a commitment to improving healthcare outcomes through data-driven approaches. Collaborated with healthcare professionals to validate and refine models, ensuring alignment with clinical requirements. The successful implementation of these predictive models has the potential to significantly impact early intervention strategies and improve patient outcomes.
